	"Hey! I'm Sarah, and I'm an avid concertgoer. I attended 10 concerts in 2024 and aim top that this year!",
	"I have a deep appreciation for all forms of musical excellence - performance, composition, improvisation - rooted in my own musical upbringing.",
	"I played clarinet through middle & high school, which gave me a love for orchestral pieces. In high school, I picked up guitar, which built my confidence in improvisation. But most notably, Iâ€™ve been playing piano since age 6. After 12 years of private lessons and countless hours of practice, I not only fell in love with the instrument, but also with the beautiful complexity of music theory.",
	"Although I pursued a collegiate education in computer science, music is still my favorite hobby. I improvise almost daily and jump at any opportunity to experience music in-person. After all, the only thing better than music is, well - live music.",
	"This mini-blog is a fun, creative outlet for me to practice my frontend design skills and a way to share my passion for music. Hope you enjoy!"
