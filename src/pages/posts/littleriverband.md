## Synopsis:

Unfortunately, my mother couldn't attend LRB due to COVID, but I certainly couldn't let a concert ticket go to waste. I arrived at Music Hall with my dad and two family friends, immediately struck by the character of the venue. It felt like it hadn't been updated in 50 years, with an awkward split floor plan and an epic hole-in-the wall retro bar in the basement. I was definitely the youngest person in attendance by nearly 30 years, but it was heartwarming to see music pull people together in all walks of life. 

Surprisingly, LRB had no opener, and honestly, they didn't need one. The crowd was punctual and amped up upon arrival. The five gentlemen took to the stage with confidence - launching into a well-curated setlist with both unreleased tracks and fan favorites. The band was personable, cracked jokes, and had a bold stage presence. I was most struck by the sheer musicianship of each artist - Each member sang well and soloed at an impressive caliber. It's clear these men have been practicing together for decades, and I look forward to whatever they do next.

## Standout Songs:
1. **Lonesome Loser** - LRB's grand finale! The vibes were _electric_
2. **Reminiscing** - Just one of my favorite LRB songs :p
3. **Lady** - Women from all around the room crowded the stage during this tune.
