## Synopsis:

Okay - Wow! Note to self - Attend more random concerts at the Blind Pig in downtown Ann Arbor - It's SUCH a laid back venue and the vibes are immaculate. 

I pulled up to this concert because I had a free Saturday night and I liked 2 Post Sex Nachos songs - needless to say, my expectations were on the floor. I was actually shocked to learn there was an opener. 

Veaux, a three-man band, took to the stage with a relaxed confidence. They felt friendly and familiar, which only enhanced their "chill and vibey" setlist. Although the lead singer didn't enunciate much, I knew immediately that I could fall in love with this band. Their calm energy was contagious - It felt reminiscent of Finneas and Hippo Campus, but somehow more approachable. Their setlist was an adequate length - They properly hyped up the crowd and set the tone for the evening. 

Post Sex Nachos arrived with an A+ stage entrance. Wearing matching "Nachos" baseball jerseys, the boys sprinted through the crowd single-file as an overhead audio announced each of them by name like they were baseball players. I even high-fived the drummer as he ran past!

Like Veaux, Post Sex Nachos felt familiar and approachable, adding to the laid-back charisma of their music - Even songs I'd never heard before felt nostalgic. The band also did a great job at getting the crowd involved by playing "name that tune" and asking for feedback on their latest unreleased single. Altogether, they were a lot of fun and sounded amazing. I'd absolutely see Post Sex Nachos in concert again!

## Standout Songs:
1. **Animals (Veaux)** - This song set the tone for the entire evening. It's loose, fun, and familiar all at once.
2. **Feel This Way** - One of my favorite PSN songs! The lead singer sounded amazing live in this piece.
3. **Growing Old** - This was the perfect encore selection! It's just so groovy and the crowd was electric.
