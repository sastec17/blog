## Synopsis:

Okay - WOW!! This is the only concert I've ever attended where _every_ song felt like an encore. 

Pink started off strong by dropping from the ceiling on bungee cords with an explosive performance of "Get the Party Started." Every song thereafter was both electric and pitch perfect. Her gritty voice added raw, genuinity to songs like "Who Knew" and "Turbulence," which only left the audience wanting more. 

Pink was incredibly personable with the audience, speaking about her late father, singing a duet with her daughter, and sharing candy with a kid in the audience. This made me feel not only conencted to Pink, but also to my fellow concertgoers. 

Although I could ramble about the intenionality and perfection in every song performed, I'll single out three breathtaking instances:

1. Pink performed "Turbulence" while on a trapeeze-type rope. Although I didn't love the song prior to the concert, Pink's near-flawless delivery while gracefully turning upside-down and sideways has made it into an instant classic. 
2. Pink covered Bob Dylan's "Make You Feel My Love" while sitting atop a white baby grand. Hearing her powerful, gritty voice deliver one of my favorite songs only made me love it more. 
3. Although every song could have been an encore, the actual encore was ridiculous. Pink attached herself to a harness and literally flew around the stadium while singing "So What." Please! Do me a favor and Google this legendary performance.

All-in-all, Pink is a phenomenal performer, sounds amazing live, and will leave your mind-blown. I cannot recommend a Pink concert enough! There's a reason this is the finest concert I've ever been to.

## Standout Songs:
1. **Who Knew** - One of my favorite P!nk songs of all time. The grit in her voice live was to die for 
2. **Make You Feel My Love** - I adore this Bob Dylan song. This live P!nk cover may have even surpassed Adele's version...
3. **Turbulence** - P!nk elegantly twisted upside down on a few curtains to perform this piece - all while sounding incredible. My mind is still blown.
3. **So What** - P!nk hopped into a harness and FLEW around the arena!!! And she sounded amazing too! Look this up ASAP!
