## Synopsis:

Funny story! I spontaneously pulled up to this concert just for the opener - Del Water Gap - without listening to a single Niall Horan (the opener) song. It then proceeded to rain for the entirety of Niall's set, but the vibes were fun regardless!

Given that the crowd wasn't there for Del Water Gap, he was largely talked over, BUT he still sounded amazing. His setlist was well-curated and he had a strong stage presence. I was impressed by his ability to converse with the crowd, and he did a great job at "hyping up" Niall. 

My only complaint is against the relatively young crowd - They didn't stop to sing "Cruel Summer" when it came on before Niall! That would have stopped my generation in their tracks - I left feeling quite old! Lol.

## Standout Songs:
1. **Ode to a Conversation Stuck in your Throat** - Although Del Water Gap was the opener - most of the crowd knew this one!
2. **Doll House** - Holden announced that this song was about his best friend. Now everytime I listen to it, I think about how much I love my bestie <3
3. **All We Ever Do is Talk** - One of my fave Del Water Gap songs!
