## Synopsis:

This was _by far_ the most expensive concert I've ever been to ($270/ticket) - so my expectations were quite high. 

As someone who aspires to evoke positive social change, I really appreciated Billie using her platform for environmental awareness. After the opener, she played a video explaining her role in the fight against climate change, where her merch is eco-friendly and she actively supports the Support + Feed foundation. 

Upon Billie's entrance to the stage, it was clear the tech for this show was going to be incredile. She descended from the ceiling on a huge floating cube comprised of televisions, which then disbanded into three separate screens - all projecting Eilish. The floor was electronic, changing colors throughout the show, and fire frequently shot up from the floor. The band, although in the center of the stage, sat on a lower level, allowing Billie to prance about the stage on her own. 

Ultimately, the stage setup allowed Billie to showcase her laid-back, free-spirited personality, as she was the only one moving about the stage. Her band, although in the center of the stage, sat on a lower level, allowing Billie to move freely throughout the show. Eilish was clearly comfortable with this mobility - moving from prancing about the stage in the way most of us dance with headphones in our bedrooms. 

Although only 22, Billie's 6 years and 2 world-tours of experience clearly shaped her into an exquisite performer. She sounded incredible and, although she was the only one moving, she took up the same space as a 60-person dance crew. The caliber of this performance was only enhanced by 20,000 people shouting the lyrics to every song. 

To make the night even better, there was a saxophonist outside LCA playing Billie Eilish tunes - and dozens of people stopped to vibe with him! 

Overall, I'd give Billie a 9.5/10, with a 0.5 point deduction for not performing "The 30th". I'd definitely see Billie again, but this time, I'll try to hit pre-sale, lol. 

## Standout Songs:
1. **When the Party's Over** - In a silent arena, Billie laid on the ground and layered the opening vocals via loop pedal. This was a brilliant demonstration of both this piece and her artistry.
2. **What Was I Made For?** - One of my favorite Eilish songs _ever_. 
3. **TV** - Billie sang this with two good friends and a guitar, making LCA feel like an intimate gathering around a campfire.
