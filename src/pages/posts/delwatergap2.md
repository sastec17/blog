## Synopsis:

I was shocked, and a little skeptical, when I heard Del Water Gap was coming to Ann Arbor's Power Center. The artist himself wasn't even advertising this event - but as an avid music enthusiast, I simply had to get tickets to check this one out.

### DINER

The opener, DINER, promptly began her performance at 7pm. Although she is just a small country artist from Portland, Oregon, her stage presence was phenomenal. She immediately commandered the stage with upbeat tunes and witty remarks, often introducing songs with a Taylor Swift-like song lyric reference. She even introduced a few songs by explaining their origin and singing the chorus acapella style - showcasing her clever storytelling and impressive vocals. Although nobody knew who she was, she captivated and engaged the crowd while simultaneously hyping up Del Water Gap. DINER served as the perfect opener for Del Water Gap while accomplishing a challenging task - turning complete strangers into fans.

I have to place her in my top three openers - trailing behind only Chappell Roan and Del Water Gap/ 

### Del Water Gap

Okay - WOW! I saw Del Water Gap open for Niall Horan in July, and this performance was miles beyond that one. Holden's confidence, tone, and stage presence were much improved. His setlist sandwiched slow songs between an energetic opening and closing, bringing fans along an intuitive, emotional roller coaster. I was perhaps most impressed by his interactions with the crowd, as he let his personality guide this performance. He candidly asked "What's the gossip?", took selfies with the crowd, and accepted a custom jacket from a fan. 

I can confindently state that Del Water Gap is much better as a headliner than an opener!

## Standout Songs:
1. **Better Than I Know Myself** - Strategically placed at the beginning of the setlist, this song set the tone for the excellent harmonies and upbeat energy that carried throughout the show.
2. **All We Ever Do is Talk** - Performed after a slew of slow songs, this tune woke UP the crowd in a ramp-up to a high-energy ending. 
3. **Perfume** - Del Water Gap ran up and down the aisles of the venue - delivering an energetic and unforgettable performance of "Perfume."
