## Synopsis:

The Bad Suns - a three-man band - opened with a lot of enthusiasm on Tuesday night. They launched into a series of upbeat, rock songs - primarily showcasing their drummer's raw talent. Their lead singer's stage presence was rather polished, and he also sounded great live. Performance wise, I'd place The Bad Suns at an 8/10. However, they earned a 10/10 in marketing themselves. The lead singer asked everyone to play their song "Communicating" on Spotify at the same time - earning themselves a chuckle and over a thousand Spotify listens instantly. 

Finneas's laid-back character was present from the instant he stepped on stage. He opened the show alone with a piano ballad, showcasing his intentionality and songwriting talents. His band soon joined him to perform more musically interesting pieces ("Cleats," "Sweet Cherries," etc.) His setlist was quite intuitive with a natural rise and fall, ending on his two most popular hits "Let's Fall in Love for the Night" and "For Cryin' Out Loud" - both of which were a blast.

Overall, Finneas sounded like his recorded pieces, and his stage presence was far more energetic than expected. I was, however, a bit disappointed in his lack of connection with the audience - I left without learning anything _new_ about him. Despite this lack of personability, I'd definitely invest in seeing Finneas again... but maybe with a price cap of $70.

## Standout Songs:
1. **Let's Fall in Love for the Night** - Great song enhanced by an enthusiastic crowd :p
2. **Till Forever Falls Apart** - I've been rocking to this since it's release in 2021. Hearing a thousand people shout every word only enhanced this masterpiece.
3. **The Kids Are All Dying** I was originally unfamiliar with this tune, but I'm now determined to learn every word. It's a sassy and honest depiction of society's ills.
