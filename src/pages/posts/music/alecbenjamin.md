## Synopsis:

Talk about concert prep: I've been following Alec Benjamin since high school, saw him perform once in September of 2022, and had his entire discography memorized. Needless to say, I was PUMPED for Alec round two. This guy was my idol.

The concert experience began like any other: traffic on I-94, overpriced parking, and a ridiculously long line to get in. After standing outside for half an hour, we were almost to the front door. Standing beside a gate near Alec's tour bus, Alec Benjamin pokes his head through the fence and says "Hi guys!" My jaw hit the floor as I forgot every word to the English language. I squeaked out a weak "Hi Alec" just before he scampered off. My friend and I couldn't believe it - We saw Alec Benjamin in the flesh - and he saw us too!! Even more shocking - nobody around us seemed phased?

After Matt Hansen delivered a heartwrenching, opening performance (I'd recommend looking him up) - Alec opened with his stroke of genius: "I Sent My Therapist to Therapy." After years of following Alec, and having just met him, I wanted nothing more than to stand and dance for a few hours. Unfortunately, the audience had different plans - Nobody stood up! I was _flabbergasted_.

Aside from my initial confusion with the crowd, Alec did a great job! He was far more confident and relaxed than in his prior 2022 performance. His stage presence had improved significantly, and he spent more time moving around & interacting with the crowd. I thought he sounded a bit pitchy during "12 Notes," but otherwise, he sounded great!

Honestly, I was mostly just proud of the personal and professional growth Alec demonstrated in the last few years. In a way, I feel like we've grown up together. I hope I get the privilege of seeing him in concert again someday!

## Standout Songs:
1. **I sent my therapist to therapy** - I bought a merch for this song. Hearing it live was just icing on the cake.
2. **I built a friend** - An unexpected blast from the past! I also love that Alec gave Merrick Hanna a shoutout for his dance on America's Got Talent to this
3. **Boy in the Bubble** - A premium example of Alec's incredible storytelling of dark, everyday experiences. This was one of the few times the crowd felt electric.
