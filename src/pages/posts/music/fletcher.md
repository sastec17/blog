## Synopsis:

This is the concert I was most excited for - I knew Fletcher's entire discography and had followed her since 2021. Unfortunately, there were a few technical difficulties that immediately put her at a disadvantage in the race for "Sarah's favorite concert." 

Fletcher experienced a triple whammy: 
1. A late stage appearance due to technical difficulties
2. Stiffling heat in the Fillmore
3. Fletcher was feeling under the weather

Ultimately, Fletcher persevered. She performed well and was incredibly personable with the crowd. Her setlist was well-curated and crafted to take the audience on an emotional roller coaster, succeeding in taking us on a journey of love, heartbreak, and personal growth. This concert cultivated a unique sense of community, making me feel both understood and connected to my fellow concert-going peers. 

Her encore was the perfect conclusion to such a heartwrenching show - "Doing Better" and "Becky's So Hot" left me confident and exhilirated. I left craving her setlist and felt like I knew her better, which is the mark of a great show. My only actual complaint: Fletcher didn't perform "Two Things Can Be True" ... Guess I'll just have to see her in concert again in case she plays it!

## Standout Songs:
1. **Maybe I Am** - This was one of my most listened to songs the summer of 2024 - Although the sound hadn't balanced yet, Fletcher's dramatic opening of "Maybe I Am" became an instant core memory.
2. **Undrunk (Rock version)** - This was a creative rendition of an already great song. Fletcher's commentary made this hilarious!
3. **Eras of Us** - This song is such an honest description of a beautiful relationship - years after its conclusion.
