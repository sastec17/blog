## Synopsis:
Things to mention: 
* Older crowd vibes
* Every song felt like an Encore
* Singing turbulence while half upside down

## Standout Songs:
1. **Who Knew** - One of my favorite P!nk songs of all time. The grit in her voice live was to die for 
2. **Make you feel my love (Adele cover)** - I adore this Bob Dylan song. This live P!nk cover may have even surpassed Adele's version...
3. **Turbulence** - P!nk elegantly twisted upside down on a few curtains to perform this piece - all while sounding incredible. My mind is still blown.
3. **So What** - P!nk hopped into a harness and FLEW around the arena!!! And she sounded amazing too! Look this up ASAP!
