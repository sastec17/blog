This was a crazyyyyy experience! I'll spare you the graphic detail, but the 16 hours leading up to this concert involved a nasty stomach bug the left me bedridden. 
* rallied to go to the concert 
* Greatest concert ever

* Expectations were quite low leading up to this concert, but quickly adjusted them when I saw the caliber at which Kehlani performs. 
* Explosive dance movements, impressive vocal presence, personable communcation with the audience, divine balance between upbeat and acoustic songs on the setlist
* I left this concert with my jaw on the floor
* My only complaint is that Kehlani didn't perform "Better Not" off the album, although I'd still rate this one a 10/10. 

* A word of advice to anyone a little tired: you MUST rally to go to a concert.
