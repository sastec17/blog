## Synopsis:
This was a crazyyyyy experience! I'll spare you the graphic detail, but the 16 hours leading up to this concert involved a nasty stomach bug. Though it was touch-and-go, I opted to rally. BEST decision ever :p

My expectations for this concert were on the floor, but they were immediately adjusted by the caliber of Kehlani's performance. It was packed with explosive dance movements, an impressive vocal presence, personable storytelling, and a divine balance between upbeat and acoustic songs on the setlist. 

I left this concert with my jaw on the floor and the absolute certainty that this is what Kehlani was born to do. My only complaint is that Kehlani didn't perform "Better Not" off the album, although I'd still rate this concert a 10/10. 

A word of advice to anyone feeling a little under the weather before a concert: you simply _MUST_ rally!!! (If it's safe and responsible to do so, ofc)

## Standout Songs:
1. **After Hours** - The perfect example of Kehlani's talents: great vibes, excellent dancing, and impeccable vocal presence. 10/10 recommend looking this up.
2. **Nights Like This** - One of Kehlani's most popular songs - The crowd DELIVERED with this one!
3. **Crash** - One of my favorites from the album :p
