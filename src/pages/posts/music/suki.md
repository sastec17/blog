## Synopsis:

This concert was always destined to be a unique experience as it was standing-room only AND I only knew 3 songs, but I'm not one to turn down a fun musical experience. 

I initially had low expectations for Suki as I hadn't followed her very long, but she quickly proved to be an EXCELLENT performer. Dressed in a fluffy pink leotard, she soaked up every ounce of attention with grace. Suki performed confidently and openly conversed with the audience, even stopping the show to check on a fan in need of water. While I didn't know much of the setlist, I do know that she sounded spot-on. My only complaint - standing for 3+ hours in a crowded pit.

## Standout Songs:
1. **Moves** - My gateway drug to Suki Waterhouse. This was the instant classic that convinced me to purchase tickets.
2. **Blackout Drunk** - The crowd danced a bunch to this one! Good times
