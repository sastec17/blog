## Synopsis:
This was by far the smoothest concert I've ever experienced. This fairy tale concert began with zero traffic, $12 parking, and no line wrapped around the Fillmore waiting to get in. If that wasn't enough, our nose-bleed seats in the upper balcony were closed, so we were moved to front row in the Loge!!! Wee ended up with an unobstructed, birds-eye view of the entire stage - and tickets were only $20!


Mei Semones and her five-piece banded opened the event. She shredded a few scale-based runs on her guitar, and the band made room for her jazz-inspired "scat" style of singing. I was impressed by the musical complexity of her repetoire, and I look forward to hearing her next album which releases in early May. 


The main event of the evening took to the stage with a refined stage presence and a badass light show. Each of the six performers were entertaining to watch - making even their lesser-known songs interesting to listen to. I was most struck by the balanced, blended sound of the band and the rounded intonation of their trumpet player.
