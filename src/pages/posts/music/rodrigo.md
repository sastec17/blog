## Synopsis:
What a fantastic way to kick off the year! Olivia Rodrigo AND Chappell Roan for $60? Yes, please!

### Chappell Roan:
Chappell opened this concert guns-a-blazin'! It was clear about 15% of the audience had pulled up for the opener, yet they delivered the same energy as a packed stadium. Although I was unfamiliar with Chappell at the time, I was immediately struck by the bluntness of her lyrics and her freedom of self-expression. Her songs were also packed with fascinating chord progressions that had me itching to learn more. I look forward to seeing what the budding Chappell Roan will accomplish in the next year.

### Olivia Rodrigo:

I honestly had low expectations coming into Olivia Rodrigo - She was a breakout Disney star with a few decent albums - But Olivia quickly shattered any prior expectations and quickly established herself as a talented performer. Not only did she sound great live - she also danced and conversed with the audience. Rodrigo even had a great mix of upbeat and acoustic songs, bringing the audience on an emotional roller coaster with grace.  

## Standout Songs:
1. **Logical** - One of my favorite Rodrigo songs to begin with, but she performed this beautifully while floating around on a moon. 
2. **Love is Embarassing** - The dance makes this one memorable. Look it up!
3. **Get him back!** - The encore performance! Olivia's confidence really seeped into this upbeat performance - earning the respect of a seasoned performer. 

## Further Listening: 
1. TinyDesk - Where Olivia appears most confident: Just a few good songs and a few good friends.
