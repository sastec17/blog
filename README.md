# Nosebleed Nation

See the live version [here](https://sastec17.github.io/blog/)

I attend _many_ concerts, and it was getting hard to keep track of them all! So, I created this frontend blog to share my live musical adventures while also showcasing my frontend skills. 

I built this project using Astro, CSS, and JavaScript. Read more about Astro [here](https://astro.build/)

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
